# CLIP-Architecture
CLIP combines Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. Zero-shot: Zero-shot learning is a way to generalize on unseen labels, without having specifically trained to classify them. For example, all ImageNet models are trained to recognize 10000 specific classe
s. CLIP is not bound by this limitation.
